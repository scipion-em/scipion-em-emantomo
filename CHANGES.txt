v3.3.2:
 Users:
  - Add validations to multiple protocols.
  - Fix a bug in the coordinates saving when picked from the viewer.
 Developers:
  - Update the acquisition order in the CTFTomo objects (field added to that class in scipion-em-tomo v3.7.0).
v3.3.1:
 Users:
  - Small fixes regarding the register of the tilt series acquisition attributes.
  - Fix the template matching output register reported by Ricardo Righetto (thanks!).
  - Fix the classic subtomo refine transformation matrices assignment when generating the output.
  - Fix the particles order in the registered output of protocol extract particles from TS.
  - Protocol 'extract particles from TS' is now semi-streamified.
  - Protocol 'tilt series alignment and tomo reconstruction':
        * Fix the sampling rate of the set of tilt series interpolated.
        * Fix the generation of tomograms when not requested.
        * The interpolated tilt series is now generated applying the transformation matrix in Scipion convention to the
          non-interpolated tilt series.
        * Input and output convert steps improved.
        * Remove form parameter 'Step between tilts' as it can now be read from the acquisition.
        * Add param to correct the XDrift.
        * Some other changes in the protocol form.
  - Protocol 'average subtomograms' adapted to work with EMAN 3D particles generated from 3D particles (the ones
    resulting when using the protocol 'extract particles from TS')
 Developers:
  - Test for TS alignment & tomo reconstruction updated to the new TCL.
v3.3.0:
 Users:
  - Prevent viewers from locking the screen focus.
  - Refine new (pppt): set unmasked halves to the resulting average instead of the masked ones.
  - Initial model new (pppt): in no. initial volumes requested is one, it generates an AverageSubTomogram instead of a
    SetOfAverageSubTomograms, allowing the scheduling with a posterior refine.
  - Fix pppt multirefine (bad assigment of the alignments detected).
  - Fix protocol extraction from TS: the chainId in the fiducials generation is correct now.
  - Update the template 2023_12_emantomo_sta_tutorial_workflow.json.template, so it calls the centralized
    CTF import protocol instead of the obsolete corresponding non-centralized protocol.
 Developers:
  - lstConvert: orders alphabetically the tomograms to prevent data mismatching.
  - update tests calls to import CTFs to the new centralized protocol developed for that purpose.
v3.2.3:
  - Hotfix: add templates dir to package_data in setup
v3.2.2:
  - Remove invalid classifier from the setup
v3.2.1:
  - Fix schedule execution
  - Fix template
v3.2.0:
 Users:
  - Template matching protocol added.
  - Clip tomograms protocol added.
  - CTF estimation protocol improved.
  - Tilt Series alignment and Tomogram reconstruction protocol added, all together as in EMAN. TS alignment converted
    to Scipion convention, so they can be used to feed other plugins (interoperability).
  - STA per particle per tilt approach protocols added:
    > Particle extraction from TS.
    > New initial model generation.
    > New subtomogram refinment.
    > New multi reference alignment and classification.
  - Remove some non-used or deprecated protocols: pca classification, tilt refine.
  Developers:
  - Tests written used the Test Centralization Layer from scipion-em-tomo.
v3.1.5:
  - Fix: viewer now only show the particle classes from the selected tomogram, not from all the set.
v3.1.4:
  - Subtomogram refinement fixed for multiple tomograms.
  - Residual sleep command removed from protocol extraction from tomograms.
v3.1.1:
  Users:
    - Fix in particles extraction -> shifts are now correctly scaled if the particles are extracted from another tomo source.
    - Coordinates extraction extracts also from subtomograms.
    - Fix: extraction box size wizard
  Developers:
    - Multiple refactoring, tests renewed, protocols re-evaluated and new useful parameter addition.
    - Version STA classic can be considered as complete, but may be expanded to the MRA in the near future.

v3.1.0:
  - First plugin release
