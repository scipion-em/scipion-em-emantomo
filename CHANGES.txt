v3.2.2:
  - Remove invalid classifier from the setup
v3.2.1:
  - Fix schedule execution
  - Fix template
v3.2.0:
Users:
  - Template matching protocol added.
  - Clip tomograms protocol added.
  - CTF estimation protocol improved.
  - Tilt Series alignment and Tomogram reconstruction protocol added, all together as in EMAN. TS alignment converted
    to Scipion convention, so they can be used to feed other plugins (interoperability).
  - STA per particle per tilt approach protocols added:
    > Particle extraction from TS.
    > New initial model generation.
    > New subtomogram refinment.
    > New multi reference alignment and classification.
  - Remove some non-used or deprecated protocols: pca classification, tilt refine.
  Developers:
  - Tests written used the Test Centralization Layer from scipion-em-tomo.
v3.1.5:
  - Fix: viewer now only show the particle classes from the selected tomogram, not from all the set.
v3.1.4:
  - Subtomogram refinement fixed for multiple tomograms.
  - Residual sleep command removed from protocol extraction from tomograms.
v3.1.1:
  Users:
    - Fix in particles extraction -> shifts are now correctly scaled if the particles are extracted from another tomo source.
    - Coordinates extraction extracts also from subtomograms.
    - Fix: extraction box size wizard
  Developers:
    - Multiple refactoring, tests renewed, protocols re-evaluated and new useful parameter addition.
    - Version STA classic can be considered as complete, but may be expanded to the MRA in the near future.

v3.1.0:
  - First plugin release
